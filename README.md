# ecosim-codecademy-project
 Ecosystem simulator python project for Codecademy

 This is my first attempt at a complete off-Codecademy project using VSCode and Github. The project is a simple ecosystem simulator, where the user can see and edit various environmental variables, spawn critters and simulate them, and save them off for later reuse. User interface is through the terminal.
